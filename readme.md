# CRUD Application

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and localStorage. It allows users to add, edit, view, and delete entries consisting of names and email addresses.

## Features

- **Create**: Users can add a new entry with a name and an email.
- **Read**: Users can view the list of all entries.
- **Update**: Users can edit an existing entry.
- **Delete**: Users can remove an entry from the list.
- **LocalStorage**: All data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage, so no backend server is required.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the application, including the form and the data table.
- **Storage.js**: Implements a class to handle all localStorage operations (create, read, update, delete).
- **main.js**: Contains the main logic to handle user interactions, such as submitting forms and updating the data table.
